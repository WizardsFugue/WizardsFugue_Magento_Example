Example on how to setup Magento complete with Composer


Install
-------

You need to execute composer with the ```--no-custom-installers --no-plugins``` argument

And you need to have a working database install. Noone has tested yet how do the magento install process with this.
So, for now use your local.xml from another install you have.

We have a mage folder with all magento specific files, like for example config files ( "local.xml", "modules/" and so on)
